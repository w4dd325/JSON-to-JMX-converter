# JSON-to-JMX-converter

Currently editing using JSFiddle;
https://jsfiddle.net/w4dd325/r8mw6Ltv/53/

Idea; 
To take a JSON file created in Postman and map key values to a JMeter JMX file.

The JMX file is a minimalistic 'Test Fragment Controller' to house a single HTTP Request (to be improved in the future to map multiple HTTP Requests within a Postman Collection.)

The 'Test Fragments' can then be imported into a JMeter test plan as needed.
